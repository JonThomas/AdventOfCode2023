Day 19:
Boy did I struggle with the second task! I first tried to go through each workflow, and sum up xmas along the way, but I wasn't able to match my answer to the one given. I then tried to solve it by calculating the probability of each rule (edge) to be successful/ activated, and then using the workflow to calculate the probability of reaching any other workflow (node), also without success.
